Question 1. How do you think XML relates to HTML? 
    XML and HTML have a very similar syntax structure. XML reminds me of object oriented programming so I'm thinking that HTML
    may use XML as a database where the "movies" tag, for example, is a class and the "movie" tags are its objects/instances.
Question 2. What are some benefits of something like HTML using XML's syntax?  
    Given the similar syntax between the languages, they're more compatible. Can you imagine what it'd be like if HTML's syntax
    were the same while XML's syntax looked like assembly code? It would be much more difficult to work with the two together.
    Another benefit is that working with XML's syntax trains us to be better at working with HTML's syntax because XML doesn't 
    allow any errors while HTML allows some small ones.
Question 3. What are some disadvantages?
    Given how similar the syntax between HTML and XML is, one may begin to confuse the two. For example, after writing in XML,
    one may begin to erroneously think that we can build custom tags in HTML. One may also begin to think that they can 
    transfer data using only HTML or display data using only XML.
